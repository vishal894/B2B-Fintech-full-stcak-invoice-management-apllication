# The objective of my project is to  build a Machine Learning Model to predict the payment date of an invoice when it
gets created in the system. Categorize the invoice into different aging buckets based on predicted payment date. Finally, the predicted payment dates and necessary data is displayed on a Web Application . This web application helps a company to visualize the entire data.
The motivation of our project is to help businesses to keep track of payment dates in an organized and efficient manner.
In this project the different technologies used are:
Different types of ML models to first predict the payment dates of various companies like Linear regression, Multiple regression, Logistic Regression etc.
For the front end development I used React js 
For Backend development Java was used to create the servlets to perform various CRUD operations on the given data. 
MySql  database has been used to store the data.
